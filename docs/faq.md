# Frequently asked questions

## Authentication problems

### Q: I got an error trying to push/pull/clone. What do I do now?

Please follow these steps to diagnose or resolve the problem:

1. Check if you can access the remote repository in a web browser. If you cannot, this is probably a permission problem and you should follow up with the repository administrator for access. Execute `git remote -v` from a terminal to show the remote URL.

1. If you are experiencing a Git authentication problem using an editor, IDE or other tool, try performing the same operation from the terminal. Does this still fail? If the operation succeeds from the terminal please include details of the specific tool and version in any issue reports.

1. Set the environment variable `GCM_TRACE` and run the Git operation again. Find instructions [here](environment.md#GCM_TRACE).

1. If all else fails, create an issue [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core/issues/create), making sure to include the trace log.

### Q: I got an error saying unsecure HTTP is not supported.

To keep your data secure, Git Credential Manager Core will not send credentials for Azure Repos, Azure DevOps Server (TFS), GitHub, and BitBucket, over HTTP connections that are not secured using TLS (HTTPS).

Please make sure your remote URLs use "https://" rather than "http://".

## About the project

### Q: How does project this relate to [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows) and [Git Credential Manager for Mac and Linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Mac-and-Linux)?

Git Credential Manager for Windows (GCM Windows) is a .NET Framework-based Git credential helper which runs on Windows.
Likewise the Git Credential Manager for Mac and Linux (Java GCM) is a Java-based Git credential helper that runs only on macOS and Linux. Although both of these projects aim to solve the same problem (providing seamless multi-factor HTTPS authentication with Git), they are based on different codebases and languages which is becoming hard to manage to ensure feature parity.

Git Credential Manager Core (GCM Core; this project) aims to replace both GCM Windows and Java GCM with a unified codebase which should be easier to maintain and enhance in the future.

### Q: Does this mean GCM for Windows (.NET Framework-based) is deprecated?

No. Git Credential Manager for Windows (GCM Windows) will continue to be supported until such a time that GCM Core is a complete replacement.

### Q: Does this mean the Java-based GCM for Mac/Linux is deprecated?

Yes. Usage of Git Credential Manager for Mac and Linux (Java GCM) should be replaced with SSH keys. If you wish to take part in the public preview of GCM Core on macOS please feel free to install the latest preview release and give feedback! Otherwise, using SSH would be prefered on macOS and Linux to Java GCM.

SSH configuration instructions:

- [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- [BitBucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/ssh-keys-935365775.html)

### Q: Why did you not just port the existing GCM Windows codebase from .NET Framework to .NET Core?

GCM Windows was not designed a with cross-platform architecture.

### What level of support does GCM Core have during the public preview?

Support will be best-effort. We would really appreciate your feedback as we work to make this a great experience across each platform we support. However, for mission critical applications, please use GCM for Windows on Windows or SSH on Mac and Linux.

### Q: Why does GCM Core not support operating system/distribution 'X', or Git hosting provider 'Y'?

The likely answer is we haven't gotten around to that yet! ðŸ™‚

We are working on ensuring support for the Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu operating system, as well as the following Git hosting providers: Azure Repos, Azure DevOps Server (TFS), GitHub, and BitBucket.

We are happy to accept proposals and/or contributions to enable GCM Core to run on other platforms and Git host providers. Thank you!
